# BB-Carousel

BB-Carousel is a plugin to quickly create image slideshows on your WordPress Website.

Creating this slideshow is as easy as inserting an image URL, choosing from four custom options, and inserting a shortcode, **[bb_carousel]**, inside of the post or page that you want the slideshow to appear.

Removing the image is even more simple. All one needs to do is click the red "X" in the top-right corner of each image from within the plugin dashboard.

## Available Options
### Transition Time
Set a number from 1 - 10. This will determine how long BB Carousel will take to switch from one image to the next.

### Stop On Hover
If checked, when a users mouse hovers over the image slideshow the plugin will no longer shift images. When the users mouse leaves the slideshow then image transition will continue as normal.

### Navigation Arrows
If checked, user friendly arrows will appear on either side of the slideshow for easy navigation of the images.

### Show Pagination
If checked, small bubbles will appear at the bottom of the slideshow for easy navigation of the images. One will appear for each image.

## How to edit image appearance
As with all images, it can be extremely difficult to create a concrete style for every single image. While BB Carousel respects a 4:1 aspect ratio, this may not be ideal for every image out there. With that said, editing the slideshow elements, from `<div>` to `<img>`, is as easy as updating your theme's CSS to target the specific element. Each element also comes with a predefined class name for easier targeting.

Remember, any changes made to the plugin files will be erased when you update to a new version of the plugin.
